    "to both learn programming with and write programs in.\n",
    "* It is readable and expressive. \n",
    "* It supports a variety of development models including object-oriented, procedural and functional capabilities. \n",

    "## Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of strategies that you can use for getting help with specific Python commands and syntax. First and foremost you can access the Python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) which will default to the most recent Python 3.x version that is in production, but from which (in the upper left corner of the page) you can select other Python versions if you are not using the version referenced by the page. Looking at and working through some of the materials in the Python [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is also a great way to see the core Python capabilities in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases you can find quite a few useful and interesting resources through a resonably crafted Google search: e.g. for [`python create list`](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=python+create+list&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also get targeted help some specific commands or objects from the command prompt by just using the `help()` function. Where you put the name of the command or object between the parentheses `()`. \n",

    "* **Numbers** - integer, floating point, complex, and multiple-base defined numeric values\n",
    "* **Strings** - **immutable** strings of characters, numbers, and symbols that are bounded by single- or double-quotes\n",
    "* **Lists** - an ordered collection of objects that is bounded by square-brackets - `[]`. Elements in lists are extracted or referenced by their position in the list. For example, `my_list[0]` refers to the first item in the list, `my_list[5]` the sixth, and `my_list[-1]` to the last item in the list. \n",
    "* **Dictionaries** -  an unordered collection of objects that are referenced by *keys* that allow for referring to those objexts by reference to those keys. Dictionaryies are bounded by curley-brackets - `{}` with each element of the dictionary consisting of a *key* (string) and a *value* (object) separated by a colon `:`. Elements of a dictionary are extracted or referenced using their keys. for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        my_dict = {\"key1\":\"value1\", \"key2\":36, \"key3\":[1,2,3]}\n",
    "        my_dict['key1'] returns \"value1\"\n",
    "        my_dict['key3'] returns [1,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tuples** - **immutable** lists that are bounded by parentheses = `()`. Referencing elements in a tuple is the same as referencing elements in a list above. \n",
    "* **Files** - objects that represent external files on the file system. Programs can interact with (e.g. read, write, append) external files through their representative file objects in the program.\n",
    "* **Sets** - unordered, collections of **immutable** objects (i.e. ints, floats, strings, and tuples) where membership in the set and uniqueness within the set are defining characteristics of the member objects. Sets are created using the `set` function on a sequence of objects. A specialized list of operators on sets allow for identifying *union*, *intersection*, and *difference* (among others) between sets. \n",
    "* **Other core types** - Booleans, types, `None`\n",
    "* **Program unit types** - *functions*, *modules*, and *classes* for example\n",
    "* **Implementation-related types** (not covered in this workshop)\n",
    "\n",
    "These objects have their own sets of related methods (as we saw in the `help()` examples above) that enable their creation, and operations upon them."

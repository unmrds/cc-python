    "## Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of strategies that you can use for getting help with specific Python commands and syntax. First and foremost you can access the Python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) which will default to the most recent Python 3.x version that is in production, but from which (in the upper left corner of the page) you can select other Python versions if you are not using the version referenced by the page. Looking at and working through some of the materials in the Python [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is also a great way to see the core Python capabilities in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases you can find quite a few useful and interesting resources through a resonably crafted Google search: e.g. for [`python create list`](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=python+create+list&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also get targeted help some specific commands or objects from the command prompt by just using the `help()` function. Where you put the name of the command or object between the parentheses `()`. \n",

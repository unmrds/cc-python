You can easily check to see what version of Python might already be on your computer by typing `python` at the `Command Prompt` (Windows) or in the `Terminal` (Mac OS) and seeing what response you get. If Python is installed you will typically see information about the currently installed version and then be taken to the Python command prompt where you can start typing commands. \n",

Following this installation you will be able to execute commands from the *interactive command prompt* or you can start the *IDLE* integrated development environment (IDE). \n",
    "* You can install a pre-packaged python system such as the Anaconda release of Python (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) that has both Python 2.x and 3.x versions available for download. I prefer this method as it installs a copy of Python that is separate from any previous ones on your system, and allows you to execute the (enhanced) interactive Python command prompt, **and** run the Jupyter Notebook web-based environment for writing and executing Python code. The examples that we will go through today will be executed in the Jupyter Notebook environment. "

Looking at and working through some of the materials in the Python [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is also a great way to see the core Python capabilities in action. \n",

From these raw materials more complex commands, functions, and modules are built. \n",

    "### Standard Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Any programming language has at its foundation a collection of *types* or in Python's terminology *objects*. The standard objects of Python consist of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numbers** - integer, floating point, complex, and multiple-base defined numeric values\n",
    "* **Strings** - **immutable** strings of characters, numbers, and symbols that are bounded by single- or double-quotes\n",
    "* **Lists** - an ordered collection of objects that is bounded by square-brackets - `[]`. Elements in lists are extracted or referenced by their position in the list. For example, `my_list[0]` refers to the first item in the list, `my_list[5]` the sixth, and `my_list[-1]` to the last item in the list. \n",
    "* **Dictionaries** -  an unordered collection of objects that are referenced by *keys* that allow for referring to those objexts by reference to those keys. Dictionaryies are bounded by curley-brackets - `{}` with each element of the dictionary consisting of a *key* (string) and a *value* (object) separated by a colon `:`. Elements of a dictionary are extracted or referenced using their keys. for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        my_dict = {\"key1\":\"value1\", \"key2\":36, \"key3\":[1,2,3]}\n",
    "        my_dict['key1'] returns \"value1\"\n",
    "        my_dict['key3'] returns [1,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tuples** - **immutable** lists that are bounded by parentheses = `()`. Referencing elements in a tuple is the same as referencing elements in a list above. \n",
    "* **Files** - objects that represent external files on the file system. Programs can interact with (e.g. read, write, append) external files through their representative file objects in the program.\n",
    "* **Sets** - unordered, collections of **immutable** objects (i.e. ints, floats, strings, and tuples) where membership in the set and uniqueness within the set are defining characteristics of the member objects. Sets are created using the `set` function on a sequence of objects. A specialized list of operators on sets allow for identifying *union*, *intersection*, and *difference* (among others) between sets. \n",
    "* **Other core types** - Booleans, types, `None`\n",
    "* **Program unit types** - *functions*, *modules*, and *classes* for example\n",
    "* **Implementation-related types** (not covered in this workshop)\n",
    "\n",
    "These objects have their own sets of related methods (as we saw in the `help()` examples above) that enable their creation, and operations upon them."

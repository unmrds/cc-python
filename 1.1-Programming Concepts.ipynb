You can easily check to see what version of Python might already be on your computer by typing `python` at the `Command Prompt` (Windows) or in the `Terminal` (Mac OS) and seeing what response you get. If Python is installed you will typically see information about the currently installed version and then be taken to the Python command prompt where you can start typing commands. \n",

Following this installation you will be able to execute commands from the *interactive command prompt* or you can start the *IDLE* integrated development environment (IDE). \n",
    "* You can install a pre-packaged python system such as the Anaconda release of Python (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) that has both Python 2.x and 3.x versions available for download. I prefer this method as it installs a copy of Python that is separate from any previous ones on your system, and allows you to execute the (enhanced) interactive Python command prompt, **and** run the Jupyter Notebook web-based environment for writing and executing Python code. The examples that we will go through today will be executed in the Jupyter Notebook environment. "

You can also start a local Jupyter Notebook instance through the *Anaconda Navigator* application that is included with recent releases of the Anaconda Python distribution.

First and foremost you can access the Python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) which will default to the most recent Python 3.x version that is in production, but from which (in the upper left corner of the page) you can select other Python versions if you are not using the version referenced by the page. Looking at and working through some of the materials in the Python [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is also a great way to see the core Python capabilities in action. \n",

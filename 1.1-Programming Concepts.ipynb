You can easily check to see what version of Python might already be on your computer by typing `python` at the `Command Prompt` (Windows) or in the `Terminal` (Mac OS) and seeing what response you get. If Python is installed you will typically see information about the currently installed version and then be taken to the Python command prompt where you can start typing commands. \n",
    "* You can install one of the available versions directly from the Python project site: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Following this installation you will be able to execute commands from the *interactive command prompt* or you can start the *IDLE* integrated development environment (IDE). \n",
    "* You can install a pre-packaged python system such as the Anaconda release of Python (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). I prefer this method as it installs a copy of Python that is separate from any previous ones on your system, and allows you to execute the (enhanced) interactive Python command prompt, **and** run the Jupyter Notebook web-based environment for writing and executing Python code. The examples that we will go through today will be executed in the Jupyter Notebook environment. "

    "1. The most simple method is to just type `python` at the *Command Prompt* (Windows) or *Terminal* (Mac OS and Linux). If your installation was successful you will be taken to the interactive prompt. For example:\n",

    "3. If you installed the Anaconda release of Python you can type `ipython` at the *Command Prompt* (Windows) or *Terminal* (Mac OS and Linux). If you installation was successful you will be taken to an enhanced (compared with the basic Python prompt) interactive prompt. For example:\n",

    "4. If you installed the Anaconda release of Python you can type `jupyter notebook` at the *Command Prompt* (Windows) or *Terminal* (Mac OS and Linux). If your installation was successful you should see some startup messages in the terminal window and your browser should open up and display the *Jupyter Notebook* interface from where you can navigate through your system's folder structure (limited to the folder that you ran the `jupyter notebook` command from and its children), and load existing notebooks or create new ones in which you can enter and execute Python commands.  In more recent releases of the Anaconda Python distribution you can run the *Anaconda Navigator* from which you can run *Jupyter Notebooks* and other applications. **This is the interface that we are using for today's workshop**. \n",

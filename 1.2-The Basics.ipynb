    "At the core of Python (and any programming language) there are some key characteristics of how a program is structured that enable the proper execution of that program. These characteristics include the structure of the code itself, the core data types from which others are built, and core operators that modify objects or create new ones. From these raw materials more complex commands, functions, and modules are built.\n",

    "Any programming language has at its foundation a collection of *types* or in Python's terminology *objects*. The standard objects of Python consist of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numbers** - integer, floating point, complex, and multiple-base defined numeric values\n",
    "* **Strings** - **immutable** strings of characters, numbers, and symbols that are bounded by single- or double-quotes\n",
    "* **Lists** - an ordered collection of objects that is bounded by square-brackets - `[]`. Elements in lists are extracted or referenced by their position in the list. For example, `my_list[0]` refers to the first item in the list, `my_list[5]` the sixth, and `my_list[-1]` to the last item in the list. \n",
    "* **Dictionaries** -  an unordered collection of objects that are referenced by *keys* that allow for referring to those objexts by reference to those keys. Dictionaryies are bounded by curley-brackets - `{}` with each element of the dictionary consisting of a *key* (string) and a *value* (object) separated by a colon `:`. Elements of a dictionary are extracted or referenced using their keys. for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        my_dict = {\"key1\":\"value1\", \"key2\":36, \"key3\":[1,2,3]}\n",
    "        my_dict['key1'] returns \"value1\"\n",
    "        my_dict['key3'] returns [1,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tuples** - **immutable** lists that are bounded by parentheses = `()`. Referencing elements in a tuple is the same as referencing elements in a list above. \n",
    "* **Files** - objects that represent external files on the file system. Programs can interact with (e.g. read, write, append) external files through their representative file objects in the program.\n",
    "* **Sets** - unordered, collections of **immutable** objects (i.e. ints, floats, strings, and tuples) where membership in the set and uniqueness within the set are defining characteristics of the member objects. Sets are created using the `set` function on a sequence of objects. A specialized list of operators on sets allow for identifying *union*, *intersection*, and *difference* (among others) between sets. \n",
    "* **Other core types** - Booleans, types, `None`\n",
    "* **Program unit types** - *functions*, *modules*, and *classes* for example\n",
    "* **Implementation-related types** (not covered in this workshop)\n",
    "\n",
    "These objects have their own sets of related methods (as we saw in the `help()` examples above) that enable their creation, and operations upon them."

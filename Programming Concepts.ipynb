Following this installation you will be able to execute commands from the *interactive command prompt* or you can start the *IDLE* integrated development environment (IDE). \n",
    "* You can install a pre-packaged python system such as the Anaconda release of Python (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) that has both Python 2.x and 3.x versions available for download. I prefer this method as it installs a copy of Python that is separate from any previous ones on your system, and allows you to execute the (enhanced) interactive Python command prompt, **and** run the Jupyter Notebook web-based environment for writing and executing Python code. The examples that we will go through today will be executed in the Jupyter Notebook environment. "

    "### Standard Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Any programming language has at its foundation a collection of *types* or in Python's terminology *objects*. The standard objects of Python consist of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numbers** - integer, floating point, complex, and multiple-base defined numeric values\n",
    "* **Strings** - **immutable** strings of characters, numbers, and symbols that are bounded by single- or double-quotes\n",
    "* **Lists** - an ordered collection of objects that is bounded by square-brackets - `[]`. Elements in lists are extracted or referenced by their position in the list. For example, `my_list[0]` refers to the first item in the list, `my_list[5]` the sixth, and `my_list[-1]` to the last item in the list. \n",
    "* **Dictionaries** -  an unordered collection of objects that are referenced by *keys* that allow for referring to those objexts by reference to those keys. Dictionaryies are bounded by curley-brackets - `{}` with each element of the dictionary consisting of a *key* (string) and a *value* (object) separated by a colon `:`. Elements of a dictionary are extracted or referenced using their keys. for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        my_dict = {\"key1\":\"value1\", \"key2\":36, \"key3\":[1,2,3]}\n",
    "        my_dict['key1'] returns \"value1\"\n",
    "        my_dict['key3'] returns [1,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tuples** - **immutable** lists that are bounded by parentheses = `()`. Referencing elements in a tuple is the same as referencing elements in a list above. \n",
    "* **Files** - objects that represent external files on the file system. Programs can interact with (e.g. read, write, append) external files through their representative file objects in the program.\n",
    "* **Sets** - unordered, collections of **immutable** objects (i.e. ints, floats, strings, and tuples) where membership in the set and uniqueness within the set are defining characteristics of the member objects. Sets are created using the `set` function on a sequence of objects. A specialized list of operators on sets allow for identifying *union*, *intersection*, and *difference* (among others) between sets. \n",
    "* **Other core types** - Booleans, types, `None`\n",
    "* **Program unit types** - *functions*, *modules*, and *classes* for example\n",
    "* **Implementation-related types** (not covered in this workshop)\n",
    "\n",
    "These objects have their own sets of related methods (as we saw in the `help()` examples above) that enable their creation, and operations upon them."

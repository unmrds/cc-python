This collection of materials was developed for the University of New Mexico Libraries' *Code & Coffee* workshop series
to provide a high-level introduction to programming concepts illustrated with the Python programming language. The
workshop content is contained in a collection of Jupyter Notebooks:

* Conceptual Overview: [Programming Concepts.ipynb](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-python/blob/master/Programming%20Concepts.ipynb)
* Surname analysis example: [Name_Data.ipynb](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-python/blob/master/Name_Data.ipynb)
* Library shelf space analysis example: [Space Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-python/blob/master/Space%20Analysis%20.ipynb)
* IR Keywords Versus IR "Aboutness" example [no longer functional due to decommissioning of UNM DSpace instance]: [IR Keywords Versus IR "Aboutness".ipynb](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-python/blob/master/IR%20Keywords%20Versus%20IR%20%22Aboutness%22.ipynb)

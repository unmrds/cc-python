## Pre-workshop setup

We will be using the Jupyter Notebook environment for this workshop. We recommend you install Jupyter notebook and the current version of python 3 (3.8 in February 2021) through the [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) download and installation as it provides a complete set of tools for running and managing a scientific python work environment on your system.

This collection of materials was developed for the University of New Mexico Libraries' *Code & Coffee* workshop series
to provide a high-level introduction to programming concepts illustrated with the Python programming language. The
workshop content is contained in a collection of Jupyter Notebooks:

Session 1 (2 hours)

* Conceptual Overview: [1.1-Programming Concepts.ipynb](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-python/blob/master/1.1-Programming%20Concepts.ipynb)
* Basic Programming Operations: [1-Intro-tutorial-babyname-data.ipynb](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-python/blob/master/tutorials/beowulf_babynames/1-Intro-tutorial-babyname-data.ipynb)

Session 2 (2 hours)

* Functions: [2.1-Functions.ipynb](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-python/blob/master/tutorials/bird_eggs/2.1-Functions.ipynb)

As the workshop has evolved over time, additional tutorials covering these same topics have been developed. The _tutorials_ directory in this repository includes those. Tutorials are organized according to the dataset used.

Other samples from previous workshops:

* Surname analysis example: [Name_Data.ipynb](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-python/blob/master/tutorials/census_surnames/Name_Data.ipynb)
* Library shelf space analysis example: [Space Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-python/blob/master/tutorials/shelf_space/Space%20Analysis%20.ipynb)
